a) Coursera courses by top tech companies : Also cover theory part related to how web/JavaScript/.. works ..... beside just teaching ; also every part of the language (e.g. HTML CSS ) is taught and nothing is skipped . 
b) But in Udemy this is not the case (no much theory and some aspects if the instructor feel are less important are skipped ;
(in some way this helps us to maximize learning in limited time ) ;  Also another benefit of udemy is that in paid course are cheaper than Coursera and has more exercises/quizzes to go through than coursera's paid course has.



USE OF COURSERA THEN : In future if we wish to know some language's all (theory & programming) aspect's without SKIPPING ANYTHING THEN GO FOR COURSERA once
